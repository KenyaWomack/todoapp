## Project: Context API

### Author: Kenya Womack

### Problem Domain

To Do List Manager Phase 1: Incorporate configuration settings to the application.

Currently, a user can add todo tasks to the proof-of-life starter application. In this phase, we will add hard-wired, default context settings to the application so that the user can view three incomplete todo tasks. In addition, the user will have the option of viewing any additional incomplete tasks by using pagination functionality
